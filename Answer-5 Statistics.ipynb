    "To calculate the probability that a randomly selected late taxi belongs to Company A, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's assume that \"A\" represents the event of selecting a taxi from Company A, and \"B\" represents the event of selecting a taxi from Company B. We are looking for the conditional probability P(A|L), where L represents the event of selecting a late taxi.\n",
